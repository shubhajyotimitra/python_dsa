#if_name_=="_main_" in python

import shubh
shubh.welcome()

#as i have already made a file name "shubh.py" and i have made another file in an order to import the things i have written in the "shubh file"
#but here is the problem when i write "shubh.welcome" then in output wil print two times 
#also if i remove "shubh.welcome()" then it will also continue and print the output only one time
