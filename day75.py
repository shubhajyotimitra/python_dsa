# Operator Overloading in python :
# Operator overloading is a feature in python that allows deveelopers to redefine the behaviour of mathematical and comparison operators for custom data types.
# this means that you can use the standard mathematical operators (+,-,*,/,etc)
# comparisonn operators (<,>,==,etc.) in your own classes, just as you would for built-in data types like int,float, and str.
