# Multiple inheritance:
# Multiple Inheritance means a child class inherits from more than one parent class.
# That is, a derived class can access attributes and methods from multiple base classes.
# Syntax:
# class Parent1:
#     pass

# class Parent2:
#     pass

# class Child(Parent1, Parent2):
#     pass
